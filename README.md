# IDORLesson
This is a project that investigates the IDOR vulnerability and how to resolve it. IDOR stands for Insecure Direct Object Reference.
# Donwload and Install Python3 if needed
To download Python3 you can use, https://www.python.org/downloads/. It is the offical webpage for the language, and ensures you are downlaoding an authentic version of the language.

This webpage provides some guidance on how to install the downloaded software. If you need more information you can refer to, https://python.land/installing-python.

There are several online resources on this, if you want to do it a different way you are more than welcome to.
# Run IDOR First
There are two project folders called IDOR and IDORFix. The IDOR folder has everything you need for the project version with the IDOR vulnerability. 

The IDORFix version removes IDOR. You will not need to use this if instructions are followed as you will learn how to remove the issue.

It is there in case you run into issues and do not want to spend any more time figuring out how to remove the IDOR vulnerability.
